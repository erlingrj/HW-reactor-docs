# HW-reactor-docs
This repo is a working document for the HW/FPGA Reactor implementation
It is diveded into two parts:
1. [Standalone HW Reactors](./standalone-hw-reactors.md)
2. [HW/SW Reactors](./hw-sw-reactors.md)

(1) is, from my perspective, more interesting (targeting SoC FPGA) and also potentially in combination with FlexPRET (which is already running on an FPGA). I will start with (2) since it is more general.
